Turborepo 1.4 lays the foundation for the future of Turborepo.

- [**Automatic environment variable inclusion:**](#automatic-environment-variable-inclusion) We'll find popular framework environment variables for you. No need to add them yourself.
- [**New framework and library examples:**](#new-framework-and-library-examples) We've added _even more_ starters that the community has requested.

Update today by running `npm install turbo@latest`.

## Automatic environment variable inclusion

One of the easiest mistakes to make when setting up Turborepo is accidentally omitting an important environment variable resulting in reusing a cache somewhere you didn't expect. Turborepo now has your back and will detect commonly used environment variables to help you avoid this problem. We already include support for the following tools and frameworks: Astro, Blitz, Create React App, Gatsby, Next.js, Nuxt, RedwoodJS, Sanity, Solid, SvelteKit, Vite, and Vue.js.

## New framework and library examples

Over the past month, we've invested a lot of time in creating new examples for how to integrate Turborepo into your workflow, featuring:

- [Svelte](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-svelte)
- [Docker](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-docker)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-create-react-app)
- [React Native](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-react-native-web)
- [Prisma](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-prisma)
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-tailwind)
- â€¦ [and more!](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples)

## Other bug fixes and improvements

- Allow both sides of git comparison. ([#1442](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/pull/1442))

- Cache files with the correct file permissions. ([#1429](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/pull/1429))
